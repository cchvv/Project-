Happy-4
========

Happy-4 is a project to find the best way to combine solar and wind energy to 
get a stable clean energy resource. 
User can just input the position and year to download the corresponding data of 
radiation and wind speed automaticly.

Data will be put into the System Advisor Model (SAM) model to simulate the power
a solar panel and a wind turbine can provide in a specific place.

Based on the simulation, this project can return a suitable number ratio of solar 
panels and wind turbines, and this combination can provide stable energy resource.

Also, figures of daily solar energy provided a solar panel, daily solar 
energy provided by a wind turbine and daily total energy are given.
